Zelestra X AWS ML Ascend Challenge - 2nd Edition
This repository contains my solution for the Zelestra X AWS ML Ascend Challenge - 2nd Edition. The project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the efficiency of a system based on various features using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow/Keras.

Project Structure
Zelestra X AWS ML Ascend Challenge - 2nd Edition Live.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and submission steps.
dataset/train.csv: Training data (not included in repo).
dataset/test.csv: Test data (not included in repo).
submission.csv: Sample submission file generated by the notebook.
Workflow
Data Loading: Reads training and test datasets using pandas.
Preprocessing:
Drops unnecessary columns.
Converts data types and handles missing values.
Scales features using MinMaxScaler.
Feature Engineering: Separates features (X) and target (y).
Model Training:
Splits data into training and validation sets.
Trains an XGBoost regressor.
Evaluation: Calculates a custom score based on RMSE.
Prediction & Submission: Generates predictions for the test set and prepares a submission file.
