🚀 Zelestra X AWS ML Ascend Challenge - 2nd Edition
This repository contains my solution for the Zelestra X AWS ML Ascend Challenge - 2nd Edition.
The project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the efficiency of a system based on various features using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow/Keras.

Feature Engineering

Separates features (X) and target variable (y).

Model Training

Splits data into training and validation sets.

Trains an XGBoost regressor.

Model Evaluation

Calculates a custom score based on RMSE.

Prediction & Submission

Generates predictions for the test set.

Prepares the submission.csv file for final submission.
